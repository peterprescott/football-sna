    "\n",
    "Association football is the world's most popular sport [@IPalacios-Huerta2004] and a multibillion dollar industry [@Deloitte2019]. \n",
    "Statistical analysis of the sport was pioneered more than fifty years ago [@CReepBenjamin1968], but has only recently begun to make a more widespread impact [@PCintiaEtAl2015]. Such analysis is of potential interest to coaches and scouts working professionally within the game, journalists and media commentators explaining the game, and gamblers and bookmakers putting money on the game. In this paper I build upon previous work applying Social Network Analysis [@TGrund2012]\n",
    "and Markov Modelling [@JPena2014] to football data, and introduce an original metric for quantifying the contribution of each player to a team's goal-scoring capability.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After thirty years of waiting, Liverpool F.C. are once again English champions [@BBC2020]. But while manager Jurgen Klopp is now guaranteed his place in footballing folklore, less well known is the name of data scientist Ian Graham, whose analysis led to Klopp being hired in the first place [@BSchoenfeld2019], and whose research team is regarded as \"the strongest of its kind in English football\" [@SAustin2020].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, I develop a rigorous account of a football match as a stochastic social network, the graph of which is generated by the movement of the ball from player to player. I then show how the adjacency matrix of a player, considered as a node in a football match's possession sequence graph, can be used to quantify his contribution to the likelihood of the team scoring, which I call *Markov Expected Goals*. Finally, I discuss the potential and pitfalls of this new metric.\n",

It includes more than three million *event-logs* for every 2017-18 match from the five major European leagues, in JSON format (see Figure 1), with  the details of players, teams, and informative tags (such as the crucial 'Goal') numerically encoded. Each event is associated with an event type (such as 'Shot', 'Pass' or 'Free Kick'), identified with a player, and includes a nested array of the locational *positions* of the event itself and its target.\n",

    "\n",
    "As part of this preprocessing stage I also labelled each event according first to its *in-play sequence*, and then its *possession sequence*. An in-play sequence ends when the ball goes out of play, as indicated by the subsequent event having the *eventName* 'Free Kick' (a category which includes throw-ins and corners, as well as actual free-kicks given for fouls or offsides); or by the final two events (the shot and the attempted save) being labelled with the *tag* 'Goal'. (Although every goal is followed by a 'free kick' from the centre of the pitch, this never seems to be included in the event logs, presumably because they are created from camera footage which focusses on the goal celebrations and tends to miss the immediate restart of play after a goal). \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, to identify a possession sequence we should just be able to iterate through the event-logs of a given in-play sequence, and note when the team of the player changes. However, since the event-logs include challenges for the ball even when they are unsuccessful, this would lead to systematically undercounting the length of possession sequences. The solution I adopt is to iterate through the event-logs for a single team within an in-play sequence, paying close attention to the location data: if the location of an event is identical to the target-location of the previous event associated with that same team, then I treat is as part of the same possession sequence, otherwise I treat it as a separate sequence.\n",

    "A *graph* is an ordered tuple $G = (V,E)$, consisting of a set of *nodes* (or *vertices*) $V = \\{v_{i}\\}$, and a set of *edges* $E = \\{e_{ij}\\}$, where the edge $e_{i,j}$ is the ordered pair $(i,j)$ representing some connection from the *source* $v_{i}$ to the *target* $v_{j}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two nodes connected by an edge are said to be *adjacent* to each other. An edge $e_{ii}$ connecting a node $v_{i}$ to itself is called a *loop*; the node is then *self-adjacent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is *undirected* if $e_{ij} \\iff e_{ji}$ -- otherwise it is *directed*. It is a *simple* graph if the edges are distinct and unrepeated -- otherwise it is a *multigraph*. \n",
    "\n",
    "On an undirected graph, we call the number of edges connecting a node its *degree*. In a directed graph we distinguish between the *indegree* and *outdegree*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph G, we can describe a *walk* of length L as a sequence of adjacent (but not necessarily distinct) nodes $(v_{0},...,v_{L})$; or, equivalently, as a sequence of edges $e_{0,1},...,e_{L-1,L}$. Conversely, given a set of walks, we can construct the (minimal) underlying graph containing all the nodes and edges involved in the walks.\n",

If we are observing who has the ball, then the sample space is the set of players on the pitch. An *event* $F$ is some subset of $\\Omega$, and the *event space* $\\mathcal{F}$ is the set of subsets of $\\Omega$. In particular, $\\Omega \\subset \\mathcal{F}$. \n",

    "To illustrate the difference between the sample space and the event space, we could observe whether the *home team* is in possession of the ball. The outcome of observing who has the ball will not be a whole team, but merely some particular player $\\omega_{x}$, whom we could call $h_{x}$ if he is on the home team, or $a_{x}$ if he is on the away team. So our sample space $\\Omega = \\{\\omega_{i}\\} = \\{h_{i}\\} \\cup \\{a_{i}\\}$, and the *event* that the home team has possession $H = \\{h_{i}\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n",

We can also talk about the *conditional probability* of an event $X$ given another event $Y$, which we write $\\mathbb{P}(X | Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *random variable* is a function $X: \\Omega \\mapsto S$. If $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ then we also have the *expectation* $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ and *variance* $\\mathrm{Var}[X]$. Again, to illustrate what we mean -- the number of goals in the match is an integer-valued random variable, and since $\\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ we could talk about the expectation and variation of the number of goals; but this is not the case for the question of which player has the ball at a particular time, though this also is a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *stochastic process* is an indexed set (that is, a *sequence*) of random variables, where the index commonly refers to points in time $t \\in T$, which may be considered discretely (so $t \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ ) or continuously (so $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{ \\ge 0}$ ).

If $S$ is countable, then the probability distribution of such a process can be described by its initial *distribution vector* $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha_{0}}$ and its *transition matrix* $\\mathbf{P}$, where each $i$th row is made up of the transition probabilities $p_{ij}$ and $\\sum\\limits_{j} p_{ij} = 1 \\forall i$. Specifically, after $k$ transitions we have the distribution $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha_{k}} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha_{0}}\\mathbf{P}^{k}$.\n",

    "Thus we can quantify, for each player on the team, the expected number of events there will be before the team scores a goal. We invert this to give a measure of the expected number of goals; and standardize it by the team's average number of events per game. We then scale this by the team's mean values, so that we can make a fair comparison across teams to see which individual players contribute the most to their teams' goalscoring chances. We call this measure *Markov Expected Goals* (MXG). \n",

    "Applying our method to the cumulative season's transition matrix for every team in the dataset, we find that Inter's Icardi is the player who contributed most to the chance of his team scoring (considering only players with degree of at least 1000). His MXG score is almost three times higher than that of Messi, who only just makes it into the Top Twenty (Table 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is instructive to consider Messi's score in order to understand what a high MXG score implies. Of the twenty, Messi has the highest number of goals, the highest number of loops, and the highest (out-)degree, but the very strength of his degree score means that his percentage of goals per degree (which correlates most strongly with MXG) is the lowest."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have here focussed on the attacking contribution a player makes towards his team's goal-scoring capability, but we could equally consider the defensive aspect by letting the absorbing state be the possibility that the opposition score.\n",
    "\n",
    "One apparent flaw of this analysis is that it pays no attention to the *spatial* dynamics of the game. But it would be fairly straightforward to develop the analysis articulated here to also take into account a player's location on the pitch when he plays the ball. Rather than merely representing the players, the nodes' state space could instead be the Cartesian product of players with some set of discrete areas of the pitch, say $\\{\\Delta, \\Phi, \\Xi \\}$ representing the Defensive Half, Attacking Half, and Attacking Penalty Area respectively. One could simply add the spatial indicator to the player name at the preprocessing stage, and the rest of the analysis would then proceed as described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the major weakness is one inherent in the data itself -- although the event-log dataset offers a wealth of information when compared to the manual *notational analysis* first developed by Charles Reep in the 1950s [@RPollard2002], a convincing analysis of football will only really be possible with data that includes the positions of off-the-ball players, as well as on-the-ball events [@RTavares2017]. Such data can be captured [eg. @SPettersenEtAl2014], but is not yet widely (at least openly) available."
